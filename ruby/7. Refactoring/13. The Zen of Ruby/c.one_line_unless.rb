=begin

The One-Line Unless

You can do the exact same thing with the unless statement. The order is the same as before: something for Ruby to do, the unless keyword, and then an expression that evaluates to true or false.

Remember, you don't need an end when you write a one-line if or unless!
Instructions

Go ahead and type a one-line unless statement in the editor to the right. It can be whatever you like.

Hint

You can try a simple one-liner, like this:

puts "Hello!" unless false

which is the same as:

unless false
  puts "Hello!"
end
=end

# Type your Ruby code below!
puts "Hello" unless false

# Output:
Hello
nil
