Ruby is a Delight

As a language, Ruby prioritizes programmer productivity over program optimization. This means that Ruby may not always run a program in the fastest way possible, but it strives to be a language that programmers (like you!) find easy and fun to use. The more intuitive a language's syntax is, the more productive its users can be. You're in control, not the machine!

Check out the code in the editor. It looks almost just like English, doesn't it?
