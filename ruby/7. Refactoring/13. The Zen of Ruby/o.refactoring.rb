# One-Liners
# All right! Time to put your new knowledge to work by refactoring some existing code. Refactoring is just a fancy way of saying # we're improving the structure or appearance of our code without changing what it actually does.

# We won't cover every bit of syntax from the previous exercises, but we'll hit the highlights. Ready?

# Instructions
# Refactor the contents of the editor to just one line of code.

# ?
# Hint
# Remember, you can convert an if statement to a single line by using this structure:

action if boolean
# Where action is a the action to perform if the boolean expression evaluates to true.


# Before
if 1 < 2
  puts "One is less than two!"
end

# After
puts "One is less than two!" if 1 < 2
