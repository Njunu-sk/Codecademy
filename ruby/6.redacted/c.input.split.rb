The .split Method

Next, we'll want to divide the user's input into individual words.

Ruby has a built-in method for this called .split; it takes in a string and returns an array. If we pass it a bit of text in parentheses, .split will divide the string wherever it sees that bit of text, called a delimiter. For example,

text.split(",")

tells Ruby to split up the string text whenever it sees a comma.
Instructions

Declare a variable called words and set it equal to the result of calling the .split method on text. Pass .split a space (" ") to use as a delimiter so that we get an array made up of the words from text.

=end
puts "first prompt"
text = gets.chomp

puts "2nd prompt"
redact = gets.chomp

words = text.split(" ")
