# Try It Yourself!
# See? Even though this block business has a little more going on under the hood than we thought, it's still pretty 
# straightforward.

# Now that we know how methods accept blocks using the yield keyword, let's define our own method and pass it a block!


# Instructions
# Define your own method, double, that accepts a single parameter and yields to a block. Then call it with a block that 
# multiplies the number parameter by 2. You can double any number you like!

def double(n)
yield n

end

double(2) do |n|
n*=2
end

# Hint
# Your code should look something like this:

def method_name(parameter)
  yield parameter
end

method_name(argument) { block }


# Question
#But my question is I don't really understand why need to do like this when there is a more easier way like the following

def double(n)
n*=2

end

double(2)

# Can anyone explain why do we need to use yield?

In the very simple example you presented, yield doesn't make much sense indeed. But the mechanism of yielding to blocks in 
Ruby provides the programmer with a great flexibility. A block is simply a chunk of code, and yield allows you to "inject" 
that code at some place into a function. So if you want your function to work in a slightly different way, you don't have to 
write a new function, instead you can reuse the one you already have, but give it a different block.

For example, consider a function that will print the members of an Array, but number them, like this: if you give 
it ["apple","banana"], it should print

1. apple
2. banana
Easy enough, right? There are several ways to do this, but I'll just use each and a counter. Instead of incrementing 
	the counter via += 1, I'd like to use the next method (you'll see why in a moment). Here's how the next method 
	works: 3.next equals 4, 99.next is 100 and so on. So here's our method (without yield):

def print_list(array, first = 1)
  counter = first
  array.each do |item|
    puts "#{counter}. #{item}"
    counter = counter.next
  end
end
Now when we call print_list(["Ruby", "Python", "C"]), it'll print

1. Ruby
2. Python
3. C
The second parameter first is optional (it defaults to 1 because of the first=1 above) and it tells our function 
where to start counting:

print_list(["a","b","c"], 99)
will print

99. a
100. b
101. c
Because I chose next over += 1 to increment the counter, and because Ruby is really awesome, we can use strings 
instead of numbers to label the list items: "A".next is "B", and so forth. Thus

print_list(["Ruby", "Python", "C"], "X")

# will print:

X. Ruby
Y. Python
Z. C
Great, right? But what if we wanted a different format for the item labels? Say, (1), (2), (3) instead of 1., 2., 3.? 
Our function does the formatting in this line:

puts "#{counter}. #{item}"
So instead of having two (almost identical) functions â€“ one for 1. 2. and one for (1) (2) 
(and so on, one for every possible idea), we're going to export that formatting thing into a block, 
and have just a yield inside the function:

# function print_list, line 4:
puts "#{yield counter} #{item}"
Now we can have a block handle the formatting:

print_list( [1,2,3], 23 ) { |n| "<#{n}>"}

# produces: 

<23> 1
<24> 2
<25> 3
Now I hope you see how this yield adds flexibility to your method. You can, for instance, have something like this:

print_list( ["alpha","beta","gamma"], 5 ) do |n|
  "[#{100*n}]:"
end
This prints... can you guess what it prints? Try to figure it out, then go here to find out the answer and see more examples.
