Accessing Hash Values

You can access values in a hash just like an array.

pets = {
  "Stevie" => "cat",
  "Bowser" => "hamster",
  "Kevin Sorbo" => "fish"
}

puts pets["Stevie"]
# will print "cat"

    In the example above, we create a hash called pets.
    Then we print cat by accessing the key "Stevie" in the `pets hash.

Instructions

    Access the key-value pair you added to pets, just like step 2 in the example above.
    Use puts to print that value to the console.

pets = Hash.new
