Call It!

Defining a method is great, but it's not much use to you unless you call it. For example, if you call a method called cartoon_fox, Ruby will start looking for the method with that name and try to execute the code inside it. (If Ruby doesn't find a method called cartoon_fox, it will return a NameError. We'll cover errors in another lesson.)

You call a method just by typing its name. Remember when you saw us type puts_1_to_10 or greeting after our method definition in the last two exercises? That was us calling our methods!
Instructions

We've set up a function, array_of_10, in the editor to the right. Call it on line 17!
