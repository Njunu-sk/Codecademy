Elsif

What if you want more than two options, though? It's elsif to the rescue! The elsif statement can add any number of alternatives to an if/else statement, like so:

if x < y  # Assumes x and y are defined
  puts "x is less than y!"
elsif x > y
  puts "x is greater than y!"
else
  puts "x equals y!"
end

=end
