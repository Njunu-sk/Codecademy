What's a Symbol?

You can think of a Ruby symbol as a sort of name. It's important to remember that symbols aren't strings:

"string" == :string # false

Above and beyond the different syntax, there's a key behavior of symbols that makes them different from strings: while there can be multiple different strings that all have the same value, there's only one copy of any particular symbol at a given time.
Instructions

The .object_id method gets the ID of an objectâ€”it's how Ruby knows whether two objects are the exact same object. Run the code in the editor to see that the two "strings" are actually different objects, whereas the :symbol is the same object listed twice.

puts "string".object_id
puts "string".object_id

puts :symbol.object_id
puts :symbol.object_id
